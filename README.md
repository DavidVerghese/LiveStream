I created a project that makes use of the user's camera and microphone. 
This is a link to the CodePen, which demonstrates my code in action: https://lnkd.in/e_zjWXju. (Please put on headphones to avoid feedback). 
I'd like to expand on this project at some point in the future to add audio and video effects to the user's microphone and camera input, similar to the Apple Photo Booth app.
